	<p>
		Our client, Global Takeover Inc., is in the middle of a crisis and they need our help.
		They have been hit hard by the economic recession and have foolishly laid off their entire IT department and sold all of their computers, servers, and coffee makers. The board of directors has now determined this may have been a mistake.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order for them to accomplish their corporate mission of world domination, they'll need a few computers and some software. They're currently the top bidders on an old Dell laptop listed on ebay and have hired our firm, Coding Challenge Technologies, to do the rest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our client needs to decide which of their three european divisions to close down. In order for them to decide which one gets the axe, we must help them evaluate the financial data from each division.
	</p>

	<h3 class="headingRed">Your mission, should you choose to accept it:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Write a program, in <a target="_blank"href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, which can read the financial data files from each of three corporate divisions: Paris, London, and Berlin. The files contain profits and losses for each hour over the last quarter. Parse the files and determine how much each division has profited or lost.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Download the files <a target="_blank" href="/download/">HERE</a>.</li>
			<li>When you're done, submit your results and code <a target="_blank" href="/submit/">HERE</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>
			This is a simple problem for an experienced developer but will require a good deal of setup and orientation for someone new to the Rust language. Consult the <a target="_blank" href="/help">Help</a> secton to get started.

					Rust is a brand new language and is essentially in an alpha state. It is probably the best systems programming language yet devised but it won't necessarily be a smooth road getting started with it. There may be some snags, hangups, hiccups, hitches, hurdles, holdups, glitches, swearing, and possibly a broken keyboard or two ... 
					<br>
					<br>
					... If you can handle that, read on.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="headingRed">Get Your Development Environment Set Up</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Install Rust</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Decide whether you want to develop in Windows or Linux. I'd recommend Linux but It's totally doable in Windows.
						</li>

						<li>
							Download the <a target="_blank"href="https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-install.exe">Windows version</a> or the <a target="_blank"href="https://static.rust-lang.org/dist/rust-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz">Linux Version</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							Installing and getting a working Rust install will be the first potential snag and could take some time. Read the <a target="_blank"href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html">Rust Guide</a> for some help getting started. Also check out: 
							<a target="_blank"href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Using-Rust-on-Windows">Using Rust on Windows</a>.
						<ul>
							<li>
								If you want to develop in Linux without having to dual-boot, use <a target="_blank"href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/6_0">VMware Player</a> to run a virtual machine from within Windows. This is what I do.
							</li>

							<li>
								My preferred Linux distro is <a target="_blank"href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/">Ubuntu</a>.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li> Get a Good IDE or Text Editor
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>Linux:</b> My preferred text editor is <a target="_blank"href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2">Sublime Text 2</a>. I'd also highly reccomend installing the <a target="_blank"href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation#st2">Sublime Package Control</a> and <a target="_blank"href="https://github.com/jhasse/sublime-rust">Sublime Rust</a> add-ons. I generally use <a target="_blank"href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">Nano</a> from the command line for editing config files and such.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Windows:</b> <a target="_blank"href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is hands down the way to go.				
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3 class="headingRed">Learn Rust</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Use the <a target="_blank"href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html">Rust Guide</a>. Don't just skim it. Type in and compile each and every bit of code from each section of the guide as you go. Don't just cut and paste. Type it in. Experiment and mess with it. This not only good for getting familiar with the syntax of a language but will also serve as a reference. <br><br>

						Being able to consult your file containing all the stuff you've learned so far is incredibly useful. Trying to memorize the syntax and specifics a language is a waste of time, your brain will do that on it's own. Use the code you write as an extension of your memory. <a target="_blank"target="_blank" href="/public/proj1.rs">Here's the code file</a> I made the first day I was learning Rust. I just threw everything in there as I went along. When I learn a new language I always make code files like this. I make a point of typing everything in by hand rather than cutting and pasting. Later, when I need to remember whether there was supposed to be a square bracket ( [ ) or a curly brace ( { ) or if I can't remember how many dots to use in the size parameter of an array literal (two), I know where to look without having to waste time googling it.<br><br>

						 The <a target="_blank"href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/tutorial.html">Rust Tutorial</a> also has some good information. The guide and tutorial are in the process of being merged together and are both works in progress. The Rust language is rapidly changing and evolving. Some of the information in various guides and in other places is out of date and incorrect.

				<h3 class="headingRed">Solve the Global Takeover Inc. Problem.</h3>
				<p> 
					Yes, it's a something you could solve using a calculator or an excel spreadsheet. Anyone with a pencil could add these numbers together. This challenge is purposely simple so you can learn the basics of the language without getting bogged down trying to engineer some complicated algorithm. You'll have plenty of opportunity engineer solutions to complex problems later. That's what programming is all about. For now though, let's learn our ABC's.
				</p>
				<p>
					The hardest part about this is learning the new language. This can be frustrating for lots of reasons but mostly because you'll feel lost all the time. Best way to deal with it is to start small and work your way toward the end one step at a time.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Break Down the Problem</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Start with a Hello World program and make sure you can compile and run it. </li>
							<li>Figure out how to open a file. You'll need to use <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/index.html" target="_blank">Path</a>, specifically Path::new("myfile.txt"), and <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/fs/struct.File.html" target="_blank">std::io::File.open(mypath)</a>. Yes, you can chain those two together just like any other functions. The double colon :: stuff looks scary but it's not at all. It's just a way to separate packages so that you can refer to various functions and types easily. Also remember that everything is case sensitive. File != file.</a></li>
							<li>
								<p>Here are some more things you'll need to know about:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide-container.html#for-loops" target="_blank">For</a> loops.</li>
									<li><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/struct.BufferedReader.html" target="_blank">std::io::BufferedReader</a>. Specifically, BufferedReader::new(myfile) which takes a std::io::File as an argument and BufferedReader::readline().</li>
									<li>You'll want to use <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#looping-1" target="_blank">loop</a> or <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#while" target="_blank">while</a> to loop through each line in the file. </li>
									<li>Use std::io::BufferedReader::read_line() to read each line.</li>
									<li>Use <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#patterns" target="_blank">match</a> to determine whether what .read_line() gives you is a line of text or an error, indicating you've reached the end of the file. You'll do this by using match on the <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/result/index.html" target="_blank">Result</a> it returns (see below about Result).
									<li>The last part is tricky because you'll need to figure out how to get each number in the text file from a line of text to an integer. You'll need to know about the global function: from_str(), and the methods: String.as_slice(), String.trim(), and Result.unwrap().</li>
									<li>Add things up into a running total as you go.</li>
									<li>Rinse and repeat for each of the three files. Do this without repeating any code or renaming the files (declaring your own function which does the stuff you need repeated is the simplest way).</li>
									<li><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println!.html" target="_blank">Print your results out to the screen</a>. Optionally, <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/" target="_blank">print them to a text file</a> if you want to get fancy.</li>
									<li>Submit your results <a href="/submit/" target="_blank">HERE</a>.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><h3><a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/result/index.html" target="_blank">Result</a></h3>
								<p>The whole <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/core/result/index.html" target="_blank">Result</a> thing can be confusing at first. Long story short, in Rust there are no NULL values for pointers. This is a very good thing and a smart decision by the language designers. In past languages (such a C, C++) when a function or method needed to return a value that represented a failure, they used NULL. So if you were to call a function expecting a pointer back, you might occasionally get a NULL instead. This causes a lot of problems in the long run. Rust instead returns these Result things which can be equal to "Ok" or "Err". These are great and easy to use once you get used to them. When a function/method has a problem it returns Err(error_message), when it succeedes it returns Ok(return_value). When you call your_buffered_reader.readline(), you're going to get an IoResult (just a type of Result) which you'll need to use <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#patterns" target="_blank">match</a> on to figure out what to do.</p>
								<p>Later, you'll be calling the global function, from_str(), to get your string of text into an integer. from_str() will give you a Result also. Because you're writing a program which will never be used in any serious capacity, you can skip using match on the Result this time, and instead just use .unwrap() on it. This is just basically a lazy way to get to the value. If there happens to be an error, it will break your program because you haven't checked for that possibility but for these purposes, who cares. Just don't make a habit of it. Use match or .unwrap_or_else() on any code you're actually going to use.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>

				<h3 class="headingRed">Google it or Text Me</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						When searching things specific to Rust, use the term "rustlang" instead of just "rust" to get better search results.
					</li>
					<li>
						Shoot me a text if there's anything you can't figure out. Don't bang your head against the wall for too long. As you probably already know, I'm always happy to explain things, even if I have no idea what I'm talking about. Sometimes, I even learn a thing or two from pulling answers out of my ass.
